#Task
Using good coding practice and techniques, implement the functions of the simple calculator. 
The manditory functions are the +,-,x and / while the other ones are optional and for you to
show off your mad skills (e.g. trig functions, hex calculator, exp functions, etc.).

#Your comments or assumptions

Integer is the only type of input. User only inputs two operands at a time with a single operator in between. User presses C(reset) after each computation. User can only enter a maximum of 5 digits for each operand and cannot compute a result that is bigger than a billion.
